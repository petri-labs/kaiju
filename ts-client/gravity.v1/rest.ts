/**
* unbond_slashing_valsets_window

The unbond slashing valsets window is used to determine how many blocks after starting to unbond
a validator needs to continue signing blocks. The goal of this paramater is that when a validator leaves
the set, if their leaving creates enough change in the validator set to justify an update they will sign
a validator set update for the Ethereum bridge that does not include themselves. Allowing us to remove them
from the Ethereum bridge and replace them with the new set gracefully.

valset_reward

These parameters allow for the bridge oracle to resolve a fork on the Ethereum chain without halting
the chain. Once set reset bridge state will roll back events to the nonce provided in reset_bridge_nonce
if and only if those events have not yet been observed (executed on the Cosmos chain). This allows for easy
handling of cases where for example an Ethereum hardfork has occured and more than 1/3 of the vlaidtor set
disagrees with the rest. Normally this would require a chain halt, manual genesis editing and restar to resolve
with this feature a governance proposal can be used instead

bridge_active

This boolean flag can be used by governance to temporarily halt the bridge due to a vulnerability or other issue
In this context halting the bridge means prevent the execution of any oracle events from Ethereum and preventing
the creation of new batches that may be relayed to Ethereum.
This does not prevent the creation of validator sets
or slashing for not submitting validator set signatures as either of these might allow key signers to leave the validator
set and steal funds on Ethereum without consequence.
The practical outcome of this flag being set to 'false' is that deposits from Ethereum will not show up and withdraws from
Cosmos will not execute on Ethereum.

/**
* `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

    Foo foo = ...;
    Any any;
    any.PackFrom(foo);
    ...
    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
      ...
    }

Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

    Foo foo = ...;
    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
    ...
    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
    }

 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

    foo = Foo(...)
    any = Any()
    any.Pack(foo)
    ...
    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
      any.Unpack(foo)
      ...

 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
     if err != nil {
       ...
     }
     ...
     foo := &pb.Foo{}
     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
       ...
     }

The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
name "y.z".


JSON
====
The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

    package google.profile;
    message Person {
      string first_name = 1;
      string last_name = 2;
    }

    {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
      "firstName": <string>,
      "lastName": <string>
    }

If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

    {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
      "value": "1.212s"
    }
*/
export interface ProtobufAny {
  /**
   * A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
   * protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
   * one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
   * the fully qualified name of the type (as in
   * `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
   * (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).
   *
   * In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
   * expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
   * scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
   * server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
   * * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
   * * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
   *   value in binary format, or produce an error.
   * * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
   *   URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
   *   lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
   *   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
   *   breaking changes.)
   * Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
   * protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
   * type.googleapis.com.
   * Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
   * used with implementation specific semantics.
